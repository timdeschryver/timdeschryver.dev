This week I got asked how to make a componentâ€™s input property required. Without giving it much thought I started my answer â€˜well, you can justÂ â€¦â€™, then I stopped asking myself the same question. So I opened a new [StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/) project and started exploring the options before giving an answer.

Before we start letâ€™s imagine weâ€™re creating a component `HelloComponent` to greet a person. In order to greet the person properly, the `person` property is required.

### Adding a nullÂ check

The first thing that came to my mind was to throw an error when the `person` property would be `null` or `undefined`.

```ts
ngOnInit() {
  if (this.person === null || this.person === undefined) {
    throw new TypeError("The input â€˜Personâ€™ is required");
  }
}
```

This doesnâ€™t change much except that it would throw a useful error message.  
Before: `ERROR TypeError: Cannot read property â€˜nameâ€™ of null`  
After: `ERROR TypeError: The input â€˜Personâ€™ is required`

### Using theÂ selector

To make the requirement explicit we can use the `selector` in the `@Component` decorator to require that the attribute on our component has to exist.

```ts
@Component({
    selector: 'hello[person]'
})
```

Resulting in the following error when we start the application or at compile time when the application is build Ahead of Time (AoT), if the `HelloComponent` doesnâ€™t have a `person` attribute.

```bash
Error: Template parse errors:
'hello' is not a known element:
1. If 'hello' is an Angular component, then verify that it is part of this module.
2. To allow any element add 'NO_ERRORS_SCHEMA' to the '@NgModule.schemas' of this component. ("[ERROR ->]<hello></hello>"): ng:///AppModule/AppComponent.html@0:0
Evaluating src/main.ts
Booting application
```

### Outcome

By putting the two together, I can say that Iâ€™m happy with the result.  
If you got a better way or see a problem with this approach please feel free to let me know, feedback is as always welcome.  
The question Iâ€™m asking myself right now, is if this is something that should be done in the first placeâ€¦ again let us know your opinion on this ðŸ˜ƒ.

Below you can find the two put together as well as the StackBlitz project ready for you to play with.

_NOTE: Iâ€™m using_ `_ngOnInit_` _but like_ [Isaac Mann](https://twitter.com/MannIsaac) _mentioned you could also use_ `_ngOnChanges_`_._

```ts
import { Component, Input, OnInit } from '@angular/core'
import { Person } from './person'

@Component({
  selector: 'hello[person]',
  template: `
    <h1>Hello {{ person.name }}!</h1>
  `,
})
export class HelloComponent implements OnInit {
  @Input() person: Person

  ngOnInit() {
    if (!this.person) {
      throw new TypeError("'Person' is required")
    }
  }
}
```
